2019 Google Season of Docs
===================================

<img src="http://cor.esipfed.org/esip_cor_logo.png" align="right" width="300" />

The [ESIP Community Ontology Repository (COR)](https://esipfed.org), is a community platform to manage and exchange terms and vocabularies relevant to the Earth Sciences.  

COR would like help honing its [documentation](https://mmisw.org/orrdoc/) through the [Google Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/) project. If you are a documentation specialist with an interest in semantic technology, please help us out.

Check out our ideas page [here](https://github.com/ESIPFed/SeasonOfDocs/issues).
