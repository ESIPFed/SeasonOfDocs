Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP) Community Ontology Repository is applying to the innaugural year of the [Google Season of Docs 2019] (https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/) program. [ESIP] is funded by NASA, NOAA, and USGS and supports the development of visionary Earth science technologies that advance our knowledge of Earth system science. 

The [ESIP Community Ontology Repository (COR)](https://esipfed.org) is a community platform to manage and exchange terms and vocabularies relevant to the Earth Sciences.  

COR would like help 1) honing its [documentation](https://github.com/mmisw/mmiorr-docs) and 2) creating engaging tutorials about the importance of semantic technologies in science through the [Google Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/) project. If you are a documentation specialist with an interest in semantic technology, please help us out.

Check out our ideas page [here](https://github.com/ESIPFed/SeasonOfDocs/issues).
