The [ESIP Community Ontology Repository (COR)](https://esipfed.org), is a community platform to manage and exchange terms and vocabularies relevant to the Earth Sciences.  


COR would like help 1) honing its [documentation](https://github.com/mmisw/mmiorr-docs) and 2) creating engaging tutorials about the importance of semantic technologies in science through the [Google Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/) project. If you are a documentation specialist with an interest in semantic technology, please help us out.

Check out our ideas page [here](https://github.com/ESIPFed/SeasonOfDocs/issues).
